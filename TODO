Things I learned when making this mod

Textures
--------

Model textures must have a single pixel on the top-left corner that will break a forced flood-fill algorithm with the engine.
For example, placing a bright blue pixel (or any out-of-place color) and making sure no adjacent pixels have the same color.

Level texture replacements (high colored, high res, whatever) go inside the "textures" folder. TGA format only.

(Windows only) For external texture replacements, use # in place of * for liquid texture file names (example: *water1 becomes #water1.tga)

Sprites
-------

Easiest way to make these is to import them with fimg (Animation -> Import and append frames)
Don't forget to set Orientation to VP_Parallel in File -> Properties
Use Origin Mode to set per-frame origins

Sounds
------

Sound samples can only ever be in mono. 44.1 KHz 16 bit mono seems to work fine.

Looping ambient sounds (wind, water, etc) must have at least 1 marker embedded in the WAV file. Ocenaudio (free) can do this.

QuakeC
------

Weapon firing signal flow
PlayerPostThink
W_WeaponFrame
(if input check was successful) W_Attack
W_Fire*** OR various player animation frame functions inside player.qc

W_Fire*** for single-tick weapon functions, or player states inside player.qc for "scripted" weapon animations
(think of the latter as states in a GZDoom weapon (DECORATE/ZScript)

CSQC
----

Use FTEQW to generate a quick-start CSQC header. Simple CSQC is much more convenient if all you're interested in is making a HUD
(no need to reimplement everything from scratch). In FTEQW, type this into th console: pr_dumpplatform -Tcs -Tsimplecs -Tid1
